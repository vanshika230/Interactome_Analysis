The Protein-Protein Interaction Network Bipartite Centrality Analysis using NetworkX Notebook aims to analyze and visualize protein-protein interaction networks using bipartite centrality measures. 

Protein interaction data plays a crucial role in comprehending the intricate relationships between gene-encoded biomolecules, enabling us to gain insight into cellular function and predict therapeutic possibilities. Understanding the structure and function of these interaction networks is essential for advancing our knowledge of complex biological systems. PPINs are complex and highly interconnected, with thousands of nodes and edges. Understanding the structure and function of PPINs is a challenging task due to their complexity. Centrality measures can be used to identify the most important nodes in a PPIN and provide insights into network structure and function.The Protein-Protein Interaction Network Bipartite Centrality Analysis using NetworkX Notebook aims to analyze and visualize protein-protein interaction networks using bipartite centrality measures. Several databases store protein interaction data, with STRING being one of the most prominent. At present, STRING encompasses over 3.1 billion interactions, involving 20 million proteins across 5,000 organisms, thereby offering a comprehensive resource for exploring protein-protein interactions. We will work on selected human proteins. Centrality measures are quantitative measures that capture different aspects of network structure and importance. The most commonly used centrality measures are degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Each of these measures provides different insights into network structure and can be used to identify different types of important nodes.This analysis provides insight into the network structure and helps to identify key players in protein-protein interaction networks. You can find more measures provided by NetworkX here :- https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms/centrality.html NetworkX is a popular Python library for network analysis and visualization, offering a range of algorithms and tools for exploring complex networks. The notebook employs NetworkX to construct and analyze protein-protein interaction networks, which are represented as graphs with nodes representing proteins and edges representing interactions between them.
