# Acknowledgments
I would like to express our gratitude to the following individuals and organizations who have contributed directly or indirectly to the success of the Protein Interaction Analysis project:

## Open-Source Libraries and Tools

- **NetworkX:** The project heavily relies on NetworkX for graph-based computations and network analysis. The open-source community behind NetworkX has been instrumental in providing a robust library for our protein interaction analysis.

- **Streamlit:** The web application interface is built using Streamlit, a fantastic tool for creating interactive and data-driven web applications. Kudos to the Streamlit team for their efforts in making data visualization seamless.

- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and processing are facilitated by the Pandas library. The functionality and ease of use provided by Pandas have greatly contributed to the efficiency of our project.

- **Matplotlib:** Visualization of centrality scores is made possible by Matplotlib. Thanks to the Matplotlib community for creating a versatile plotting library.

## Data Providers

- **STRING Database:** The project relies on the STRING database for protein-protein interaction data. We appreciate the efforts of the STRING Database team for maintaining and providing valuable protein interaction data.
